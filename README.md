# SmartTraffic AI

This project is part of the Building AI course by the University of Helsinki and Reaktor.

## Project Idea
**SmartTraffic AI** is an AI-based system that uses traffic camera data and historical traffic patterns to optimize traffic light timing in real-time. The goal is to reduce congestion and emissions in urban areas.

## How it Works
- Collects sample traffic data (simulated for this project)
- Trains a simple decision-tree model to suggest light timings
- Evaluates the system's performance based on average vehicle wait times

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `smart_traffic_ai.ipynb`
3. Run each cell to see the model in action
